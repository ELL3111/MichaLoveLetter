			Hello my valentine, i'm always thinking of you. Your beauty, your voice, your sweet laugh, anything about you every day.
			 Well, i don't where i have to start. I just want to say,
			<br><b> I'm very lucky to have you ❀ </b><br><br>
			Sometimes i think like, can i be your man? 
			i really want to be your man, your favorite person, fight for you, earn a living for you, have and raise children with you, stay and grow old with you <i>hehe.</i>
			<br>Cause it's like,
			<br><b>Love, you are so magnificent gorgeous, inside and even outside✦✧⋆ﾟ</b><br><br>
			I am so in love with you, i can't describe it. How am i express it? it's so deep, huge, and infinity. 
			But, it's not just about appeareance, characteristic, etc. I mean, there is so many flowers in earth, so many life and nature.
			But no one can match you, love. This is how i feel. So it's about you, Micha. I love you because it's you.
			in the end, only one sentence could be used to express it.
